    <h4 class="name privatewillis">PRIVATE WILLIS</h4>
    <p class="song">
        When all night long a chap remains<br>
        On sentry-go, to chase monotony,<br>
        He exercises of his brains,<br>
        That is, assuming that he’s got any.<br>
        Though never nurtured in the lap<br>
        Of luxury, yet I admonish you,<br>
        I am an intellectual chap,<br>
        And think of things that would astonish you.<br><br>

        I often think it’s comical—fal, lal, la!<br>
        How Nature always does contrive—fal, lal, la!<br>
        That every boy and every gal<br>
        That’s born into the world alive<br>
        Is either a little Liberal<br>
        Or else a little Conservative!<br>
        Fal, lal, la!

    <p class="song">
        When Britain really ruled the waves—<br>
        (In good Queen Bess’s time)<br>
        The House of Peers made no pretence<br>
        To intellectual eminence,<br>
        Or scholarship sublime;<br>
        Yet Britain won her proudest bays<br>
        In good Queen Bess’s glorious days!

    <p class="song">
        Yes, Britain won her proudest bays<br>
        In good Queen Bess’s glorious days!

    <p class="song">
        In vain to us you plead—don’t go;<br>
        Your prayers we do not heed—don’t go!<br>
        It’s true we sigh,<br>
        But don’t suppose<br>
        A tearful eye<br>
        Forgiveness shows.

    <p class="song">
        Oh, foolish fay,<br>
        Think you, because<br>
        His brave array<br>
        My bosom thaws,
    </p>

    <h4 class="name phyllis">PHYLLIS</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        (half crying) I can’t think why I’m not in better spirits! I’m engaged to two noblemen at once. That ought to be enough to make any girl happy. But I’m miserable! Don’t suppose it’s because I care for Strephon, for I hate him! No girl could care for a man who goes about with a mother considerably younger than himself!

    <p class="speech">
        Don’t! How dare you? Oh, but perhaps you’re the two noblemen I’m engaged to?<br>
        Ld. Mount. I am one of them.<br>
        Ld. Toll. I am the other.<br>
        Phyl. Oh, then, my darling! (to Mountararat.) My own! (to Tolloller.) Well, have you settled which it’s to be?
